          This is not an exhaustive CSS framework meant to handle all scenarios.
          Rather it is a a simple css file you can use when you want something
          better than default browser styles, but don't want to write any custom
          CSS yourself.

        <h2>Down the Rabbit-Hole</h2>

        <p>
          Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
          bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into
          the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or
          conversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice
          “without pictures or conversations?”
        </p>

        <p>
          So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the
          hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of
          making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and
          picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran
          close by her.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Down</li>
          <li>the</li>
          <li>rabbit</li>
          <li>hole</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it
          so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh
          dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards,
          it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the
          time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a
          watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried
          on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she
          had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a
          watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across
          the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop
          down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>Down</li>
          <li>the</li>
          <li>rabbit</li>
          <li>hole</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>The Pool of Tears</h3>

        <p>
          “Curiouser and curiouser!” cried Alice (she was so much surprised,
          that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); “now
          I’m opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye,
          feet!” (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost
          out of sight, they were getting so far off). “Oh, my poor little feet,
          I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears?
          I’m sure I shan’t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to
          trouble myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;—but I
          must be kind to them,” thought Alice, “or perhaps they won’t walk the
          way I want to go! Let me see: I’ll give them a new pair of boots every
          Christmas.”
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          Alice’s Right Foot, Esq., Hearthrug, near the Fender, (with Alice’s
          love).
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Oh dear, what nonsense I’m talking!” Just then her head struck against
          the roof of the hall: in fact she was now more than nine feet high,
          and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the
          garden door.
